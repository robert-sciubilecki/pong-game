This is a Pong game application.

While this application drew some inspiration from Dr. 
Angela Yu's '100 days of code' bootcamp, I authored the code independently, 
initially without reference to the course explanations. 
As a result, the implementation differs from what is presented in 
the bootcamp. The implementation I've developed is more advanced and visually 
appealing. For added fun, I included animations for the paddles. 
Although there might be more optimal methods, the current implementation 
works effectively, which is the primary goal.

Furthermore, the application incorporates safeguards to handle many 
unforeseeable outcomes. However, there are certain edge cases 
where the collision between the ball and the paddle may not be recognized 
correctly at this point.

This game was created using the Turtle library.
